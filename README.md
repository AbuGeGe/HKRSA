## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like HKRSA in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate HKRSA into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '7.0'

pod 'HKRSA'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
